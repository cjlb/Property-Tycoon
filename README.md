A Software Engineering group Java project at university, created using Agile Methodology. The game works very similarly to monopoly and has an  option to use players whose decisions are made using basic artificial intelligence. My role during this project was to take technical lead
and be responsible for delivering the main model logic and testing, as well as providing support to the front end team.
